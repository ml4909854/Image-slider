# Image-slider
A sleek and interactive image slider application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates dynamic image transitions, auto-sliding functionality, and dot-based navigation in a modern and responsive UI.

# Features ✨
Dynamic Image Transition: Navigate through a collection of images using Next and Prev buttons.
Auto-Sliding: Automatically slides to the next image every second for seamless viewing.
Dot Navigation: Allows users to click dots to jump directly to a specific image.
Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
Pause on Interaction: Automatically pauses the auto-sliding when users manually interact.
How It Works 🛠️
Images: Predefined list of images loaded dynamically into the slider.
Navigation Buttons:
Next: Moves to the next image.
Prev: Moves to the previous image.
Dots: Indicates the current image and provides click-based navigation.
Auto-Sliding: Automatically cycles through images every second, which pauses upon user interaction.
